#use of Tuple
#Tuple is a immutable list
#once tuple is created we cannot add and remove elements from tuple
#We cannot change
'''like exam write
supplies are also written
supplies are pass then
another certificate come
but previous one is not change'''
#string is immutable but slicing is done
#Tuple is also slicing is done

'''a=()#empty tuple
print(a)
a=()*2#empty tuple
print(a)'''

'''a=(2)*2#integer so multiplication done
print(a)
print(type(a))'''
#in tuple single value indicated for any task then "," is mandatory
#()-->packed and without () then unpacked
'''a=(2,)*2#packed#Repeatation
print(a)
print(type(a))'''
'''a=2,3
print(a)'''
